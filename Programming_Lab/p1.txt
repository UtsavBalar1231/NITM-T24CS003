# Stock Trading Problem

Trader has series of stock prices over 'n' consecutive days.
Trader is permitted to perform k transactions.

A trasaction is a single buy followed by a single sell.

A new transaction can only be initiated after the completion of previous one.

GOAL: Determine the max possible profit after the trader can achieve given the contraints on the number of transactions and the requirement that each buy must precede its corresponding sell.

INPUTS:
- Int 'n' number of days
- Int 'k' max number of transactions
- Array of prices where prices[i] is the stock price on day i (0 <= i < n)


OBJECTIVE:
Calculate max profit that can be attained by strategically executing up to 'k' buy-sell transactions. 

Each transaction must start with a buy on the day and end with a sell on a subsequent day.

CONTRAINTS:
1. 1 <= n <= 10^5
2. 1 <= k <= 100
3. 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4
